Send a block from your Roam Research graph to your Readwise library.

This extension provides a Command Palette command to send the content of a block to Readwise.io. Simply click into the block in Roam Research, and Send to Readwise via the Cmmand Palette. The extension even allows you to process your tags in Roam Research and converts them to Readwise.io tags.

You can configure the title of the 'book' in Readwise, whether your notes are stored as books or articles, whether to remove or replace tags from the block, and whether to leave a link to the highlight at the end of the block in Roam Research.

You need to get an access token at https://readwise.io/access_token. Settings are configured within the Roam Depot menus.
